Starcraft Empires for Stellaris:

- Protoss Empire
- Terran Dominion
- Zerg Swarm

The Empires use the supplied animated Alien models or static images. Each empire has it's specific flag as separate artwork. All empires come with a custom AI. If you have the mod activated, all three empires will be in your game - unless you are playing one of them or not enough empire slots are provided.

AI:
- The Protoss are honourable and reasonable but will freak out if you settle near them
- The Terran Dominion is very opportunistic and also willing to trade - watch your back
- The Zerg Swarm is not to reason with: They will come after everyone, weakest empires first
